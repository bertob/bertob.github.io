<h1 class="header">Hi, I'm Tobias.</h1>

<p>
I am a Computer Science student and freelance designer from Italy. I like design, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" title="free as in freedom">free software</a>, the web and making cool stuff. You can read my <a href="http://blog.tobiasbernard.com">Blog</a>, look at my <a href="/">Portfolio</a>, fork my projects on <a href="github.com/bertob">Github</a> or <a href="mailto:hi@tobiasbernard.com">Email me</a>.
</p>
<p>
I am currently available for freelance design work. If you need a brand identity, app interface, icon etc. please get in touch. 
</p>
<p>
If you are part of a free software project you can ask me to help you with the design of your project (interface, icon, website or whatever else you need).<br>If your project is cool I am likely to say yes ;)
