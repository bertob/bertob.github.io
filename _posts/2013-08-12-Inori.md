{% include info.html %}

Inori is an experimental prototype-oriented programming language inspired by Clojure, Ruby and Scala, among others. For more information have a look at the project's [website](http://inori-lang.org/) and [Github page](https://github.com/inori-lang), though the project is not currently under active development.

The brand identity I developed for the project reflects the language:
It is experimental, unusual and interesting.
