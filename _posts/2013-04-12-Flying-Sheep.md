{% include info.html %}

Flying Sheep is a group of filmmakers from Bolzano, Italy. The name comes from a [Monty Python sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkw2DdoskPY) from 1969, part of the television series "[Monty Python's Flying Circus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus)".

The logo illustration I designed for them reflects the sketch: funny, playful, kind of odd and, importantly, retro-looking. With its uneven, imperfect forms, old-school color palette and custom typography it captures the spirit of the show in a simple and concise way.
