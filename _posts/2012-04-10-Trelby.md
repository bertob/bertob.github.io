[Trelby](http://trelby.org) is a free and open source cross-platform screenwriting app.

In early 2012 I designed a new icon for it, which looks much nicer than the previous one, respects the HIG of the various platforms it is used on better and has different versions optimized for different sizes.

Note: I was not involved in the design and development of the application itself.
