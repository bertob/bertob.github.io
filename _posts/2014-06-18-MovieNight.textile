_Unibz Movie Night_ is a student event at the Free University of Bolzano organized by the student organization Kikero.

Between March 2014 and June of 2015 there were 37 movie screenings on a more or less weekly basis. For each of the screenings, I designed a custom poster which was used to promote the event throughout the university and online.

It was a fun project for me, because we had creative control over practically everything; from the identity, to the layout, to the individual illustrations on the posters. We even managed to get the Kikero logo changed to fit in better with our posters (If you look closely, you'll notice that the season 3 posters have a slightly different logo in the bottom right).

The process of printing the posters regularly was also interesting. It definitely made me appreciate the web as a medium more, where jammed printers, color profiles and the like aren't an issue.

Here's a selection of some of my favorites, for the complete series check out this "PDF with all the posters":/assets/movienight-posters.pdf.
