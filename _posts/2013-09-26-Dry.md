[Dry](http://dry.sparber.net) is a minimalistic weather app designed and developed in 24 hours by [Julian Sparber](http://julian.sparber.net) and myself for the [2013 Open Data Hackathon](http://hackathon.opengisdata.eu/), organized by TIS Innovation Park in Bolzano. We chose the name "Dry" because that's literally the only thing the app does: Keeping you dry by telling you when you need an umbrella.

The basic thinking process behind it was that while most weather apps display a ton of very detailed information, they don't really solve a problem.

So instead of thinking about the weather information itself, we thought about what kinds of problems we could solve with it.
After analyzing different apps we came to the conclusion that the only thing we actually cared about was __whether or not it is going to rain on a given day__, so we decided to build an app that does just that.

The way we implemented it, it consists of two components:
* Passive: A simple webapp that uses geolocation and the OpenWeatherMap API to display an info screen with the current weather condition
* Active: A web notification once a day if it is going to rain that day

The current version of the app is pretty unstable and more of a proof-of-concept than an actual product, but as long as you're using a recent version of Firefox (both desktop and Android) it should work fine most of the time.

You can [try it for yourself](http://dry.sparber.net) on our test server.

The app is licensed under the GPLv3, the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/realnumbers/isitgonnarain).
There's also a [design repo](https://github.com/realnumbers/isitgonnarain-design) with the the mockups, icons etc. I created for the project.
