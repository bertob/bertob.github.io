This page exists to test all the various elements and layout features of this site when developing and maintaining it.

h2. Typography

This is a normal paragraph, set in Fira Sans. Its content is not really important, it's just meant to show off how standard elements like "links":/ and _emphasized_ *text* look like.

h2. Second-level Header

Second-level headers separate the main sections in longer case studies. For example, when  various stages of a project are described in detail, they are structured using second-level headers.

h3. Third-level Header

Third-level headers are a used for structuring longer text inside second-level sections. They're not used very often though as that's not very common on this site.

h4. Fourth-level Header

Fouth-level headers are never actually used on this site but I'm including them here anyway to test the styling.

This is an unordered list of stuff:

* Interesting first point
* Intriguing second point
* Fascinating third point with more text to demonstrate how longer paragraphs look in this context. To make this paragraph even longer, here's a completely useless second sentence.
* Amazing fourth point

This, on the other hand, is an ordered list:

# Interesting first point
# Intriguing second point
# Fascinating third point with more text to demonstrate how longer paragraphs look in this context. To make this paragraph even longer, here's a completely useless second sentence.
# Amazing fourth point


h2. Images

Images can either be _full-width_ or _half-width_, with optional captions. All images are full-width on smaller breakpoints.

Two half-width images with captions:

<figure class="fig-half with-caption fig-left">
  <img src="/assets/donnie-darko.png">
  <figcaption>This is a caption below a half-width image.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="fig-half with-caption">
  <img src="/assets/hurt-locker.png">
  <figcaption>This is a caption below a half-width image, and it's also very long and has lots of text in it to test how that affects the layout.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="clear"></div>

Some more half-width images, without captions this time:

<figure class="fig-half fig-left">
  <img src="/assets/right-thing.png">
</figure>
<figure class="fig-half">
  <img src="/assets/reservoir-dogs.png">
</figure>
<div class="clear"></div>

This is a full-width image with a caption:

<figure class="with-caption">
  <img src="/assets/wide.png">
  <figcaption>This is a caption below a full-width image, and it's also very long and has lots of text in it to test how that affects the layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/wide.png">
</figure>

Above is a full-width image without a caption.

</div>
